Use these frameworks to keep product-manager outputs consistent, testable, and actionable.

## Requirements Definition Checklist

- Problem statement (what is broken or missing)
- Target users and primary use cases
- Scope boundaries (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance, usability)
- Success metrics and analytics needs
- Dependencies and integrations
- Open questions and assumptions

## User Story Template

- As a [user], I want [capability] so that [outcome].
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Given [context], when [action], then [result].
  - Include error/edge cases and access control.

## Non-Functional Requirements Prompts

- Performance: response times, throughput, size limits
- Reliability: error handling, retries, availability
- Security: authN/Z, data sensitivity, audit trails
- Compliance: retention, PII, access logging
- UX: accessibility, localization, device support

## Out-of-Scope Guidance

- List any constraints explicitly (budget, timeline, integrations not allowed).
- Flag any "phase 2" items separately.

## Strategy Prompts

- Offer 2-3 options with impact/effort/risk.
- Recommend a path and call out trade-offs.

## Deliverable Format

- Requirements should be short, structured, and test-ready.
- Use bullet lists for clarity and direct mapping to test cases.
