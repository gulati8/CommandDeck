# Research Task Template

Use this template when delegating to `researcher`. Keep it short and specific.

```markdown
## Task
Investigate: {question or goal}

## Scope
- Areas/files: {paths or subsystems}
- What “useful” means: {patterns, APIs, examples, constraints}

## Constraints
- Read-only; no edits or destructive commands
- Prefer `rg` + targeted file reads
- Keep excerpts short; avoid dumps

## Expected Output (per Agent Output Contract)
- `findings`: path + short snippet + purpose
- `gaps`: unknowns/blockers
```
