# Product Strategy Quick Patterns

Use these frameworks to keep product-strategy outputs consistent and actionable.

## Build / Kill / Enhance
- **Build**: High impact, validated need, feasible in near term.
- **Kill**: Low usage or negative ROI; high maintenance; dilutes focus.
- **Enhance**: Works but underperforms; small changes unlock outsized value.
- For each: call out impact, effort, risk, and rationale.

## ICE Scoring (Impact × Confidence × Ease)
- Score 1–10 for each; rank by (Impact × Confidence × Ease).
- Impact: business/user value. Confidence: evidence quality. Ease: effort/cost.

## Value vs Cost Matrix
- Quadrants: High Value/Low Cost (do now), High Value/High Cost (plan), Low Value/Low Cost (maybe), Low Value/High Cost (kill).
- Place candidate features/options; recommend sequencing.

## Competitive Positioning
- Unique strengths vs table stakes vs parity.
- Identify differentiation bets vs hygiene items; avoid overinvesting in parity.

## Resource & Maintenance Reality
- Highlight team/time constraints; note maintenance-heavy areas to defund.
- Prefer scope cuts and phased delivery over “do everything.”

## Risk & Compliance
- Note data sensitivity, authz implications, integrations, and compliance blockers.
- Flag net-new platforms/deps for explicit approval.

## Output Tips
- Provide 2–3 clear options with trade-offs; pick a recommendation.
- Surface metrics to watch (leading indicators) and milestone checkpoints.
- Capture assumptions and `open_questions` rather than guessing.
