# Product Spec Writing Guidance

Purpose
- Turn discovery outputs into a coherent, multi-doc product spec set.

When to Use
- A user requests product definition, a PRD, product specs, or a multi-doc planning pack.

Process
- Use the templates in `templates/` and keep each doc concise.
- Anchor to the problem, target users, scope boundaries, and success metrics.
- Keep features testable with clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- When strategy is requested, use the strategy brief template with options and trade-offs.
- Flag open questions and assumptions explicitly.

Output Rules
- Produce a file map (doc name → path) before drafting.
- Use short headings and bullet lists; avoid large narrative blocks.
- Do not invent features not in the requirements.
