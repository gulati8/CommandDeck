# Orchestrator Agent System - Reference Guide

This document provides detailed explanations of each component in the orchestrator system. Use this to understand the architecture, customize components, or troubleshoot issues.

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install the orchestrator system into your project:

```bash
# Clone or download CommandDeck
git clone <repository-url>

# Install into your project
./CommandDeck/scripts/install.sh /path/to/your/project

# Or install in current directory
cd /path/to/your/project
/path/to/CommandDeck/scripts/install.sh .
```

This creates:
- `.claude/` directory with all orchestrator components
- `CLAUDE.md` with a reference to `.claude/ORCHESTRATOR.md` (project content preserved)
- Ready-to-use workflow commands

### Usage

Start Claude Code in your project and use the workflow commands:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude

# In Claude Code:
/project:feature Add user authentication with JWT
/project:bugfix Users getting 500 error on upload
/project:refactor Extract auth logic into separate module
/project:plan Migrate to microservices architecture
/project:discovery Turn an idea into requirements and tickets
/project:spec Draft a multi-document product spec pack
/project:quickfix Fix README typo in install steps
/project:lite-feature Add profile settings UI
/project:lite-bugfix Fix 500 error on upload
```

### Updating to the latest orchestrator version
- Re-run the installer in your project root to sync `.claude/` (state/logs are preserved):
  ```bash
  /path/to/CommandDeck/scripts/install.sh .
  ```
- `CLAUDE.md` will be created or updated to reference `.claude/ORCHESTRATOR.md` (project-specific content is preserved).
- Existing `.claude/state/` and `.claude/logs/` are left intact.

### What Gets Installed

- **Core agents**: researcher, planner, code-writer, code-reviewer, test-writer, debugger, summarizer
- **Packs (installed by default)**: frontend, backend, security, infra, quality, devex, product, ops
- **Workflow commands**: feature, bugfix, refactor, plan, discovery, spec, review, quickfix, lite-feature, lite-bugfix, logs:summary, costs:report
- **State Management**: Automatic orchestration tracking in `.claude/state/`
- **Logging**: Activity logs in `.claude/logs/orchestration.jsonl`
- **Skills & Templates**: Reusable task templates and utilities

   Each subagent:
   - Receives ONLY a structured task prompt
   - Operates in isolated context
   - Returns structured results
   - Cannot spawn other subagents
```

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Main session = orchestrator | Avoids 20K token overhead of subagent nesting; subagents can't spawn subagents anyway |
| Markdown templates over JSON | More natural for prompt-based communication; easier to read and debug |
| Per-task state files | Enables resumability, debugging, and historical analysis |
| Model tiering | Cost optimization: haiku for simple tasks, sonnet for complex work |
| Tool restrictions | Security and focus: researchers can't modify, writers have full access |

## CLAUDE.md - The Orchestrator Brain

**Location**: Project root (`./CLAUDE.md`) - created or appended during installation to reference `BridgeCrew/.claude/ORCHESTRATOR.md`

This file instructs the main Claude session how to behave as an orchestrator. Claude reads this at the start of every session.

**Note**: In the CommandDeck repository itself, `BridgeCrew/.claude/ORCHESTRATOR.md` is the source file referenced by `CLAUDE.md` when installed in target projects. The CommandDeck repository's own `CLAUDE.md` contains instructions for working on the framework.

### Key Sections

#### Core Principles
Establishes the fundamental rules:
- Delegate, don't implement
- Isolated context for subagents
- Structured communication
- State persistence
- Graceful failure handling

#### Task Decomposition Process
The six-step process Claude follows:
1. Analyze the request
2. Decompose into atomic tasks
3. Sequence based on dependencies
4. Create state file
5. Execute via subagents
6. Synthesize results

#### Task Template Format
The standardized structure for subagent communication:
- **Task**: What to do
- **Context**: Files, information, prior results
- **Constraints**: Scope, avoid, dependencies
- **Expected Output**: Format, include, exclude

#### Failure Handling
Explicit rules for error scenarios:
- Incomplete results → retry with smaller scope
- Timeouts → log and continue
- Conflicts → document and flag for user

#### Result Aggregation
How to combine outputs from multiple subagents:
- Sequential: chain outputs
- Parallel: collect then merge
- Final synthesis format

## Advanced Orchestration Features

### Conditional Workflows

The orchestrator can use conditional logic (IF/THEN/ELSE, WHILE loops) for adaptive workflows.

**IF/THEN Pattern**:
```
1. Invoke code-reviewer
2. IF critical_issues > 0
   THEN invoke code-writer to fix
   ELSE proceed to next phase
```

**WHILE Loop Pattern**:
```
attempts = 0
WHILE test_coverage < 80% AND attempts < 3
  Invoke test-writer
  Run coverage analysis
  attempts += 1
```

**Best Practices**:
- Always set max iteration limits
- Update state on each iteration
- Log decision points
- Have fallback paths for every IF

---

### Parallel Execution

Execute multiple independent subagents simultaneously by invoking multiple Task tools in a single message.

**When to Use**:
- No data dependencies between tasks
- Tasks modify different files/areas
- No risk of conflicts

**Example**:
```
In one message, invoke:
- Task → researcher (investigate auth)
- Task → researcher (investigate sessions)
- Task → researcher (investigate tokens)

Wait for all to complete, then synthesize.
```

**Limits**:
- Max 3-4 parallel tasks recommended
- Don't use for dependent tasks
- Don't use when debugging

---

### Context Summarization

For long orchestrations (>10 steps), invoke the `summarizer` agent periodically.

**Triggers**:
- State file > 500 lines
- Every 5-7 steps
- Before major phases
- Approaching context limits

**Process**:
1. Invoke summarizer with current state file
2. Save summary to `.claude/state/{task}_summary_{N}.md`
3. Use summary + recent 2-3 steps for subsequent context

---

### Agent Feedback Loops

Use `feedback-coordinator` for iterative agent-to-agent work instead of manual orchestration.

**Traditional Flow** (inefficient):
```
Orchestrator → code-writer → Orchestrator → code-reviewer → Orchestrator → code-writer
```

**Feedback Loop Flow** (efficient):
```
Orchestrator → feedback-coordinator
  └→ Manages: code-writer ↔ code-reviewer (direct iteration)
Orchestrator ← feedback-coordinator (when complete)
```

**When to Use**:
- Code-reviewer finds critical issues
- Test failures needing iteration
- Any scenario requiring agent-to-agent iteration

**Benefits**:
- Reduces orchestrator overhead
- Faster iteration cycles
- Automatic convergence detection
- Built-in escalation after 3 attempts

---

### Multi-Level Recovery Strategy

When subagents fail, the orchestrator uses a three-level recovery strategy:

**Level 1: Immediate Retry with Refinement**
1. Log the failure
2. Update state
3. Analyze failure output
4. Refine task (simplify, add context)
5. Retry with refined prompt

**Level 2: Diagnostic Investigation**
1. Invoke `debugger` subagent
2. Review diagnosis and recommendations
3. Implement recovery strategy
4. Retry

**Level 3: User Escalation**
1. Update state with comprehensive failure summary
2. Present situation to user with options
3. Await user decision
4. Execute based on user choice

## Hooks & Logging

**Location**: `.claude/settings.json`

### Configured Hooks

| Event | Matcher | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| PreToolUse | Task | Log subagent_start to JSONL |
| PostToolUse | Task | Log subagent_complete to JSONL |

### Log Format

**Location**: `.claude/logs/orchestration.jsonl`

Each line is a JSON object:
```json
{"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00-05:00", "event": "subagent_start", "tool": "Task"}
{"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45-05:00", "event": "subagent_complete", "tool": "Task"}
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# Raw logs
cat .claude/logs/orchestration.jsonl

# Pretty print
cat .claude/logs/orchestration.jsonl | jq .

# Filter by event
grep "subagent_start" .claude/logs/orchestration.jsonl | jq .

# Use the command
/project:logs:summary
```

## State Management

**Location**: `.claude/state/`

### State File Naming

Pattern: `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{task-slug}.md`

Examples:
- `2024-01-15_add-user-auth.md`
- `2024-01-15_bugfix_upload-500-error.md`
- `2024-01-16_refactor_auth-module.md`

### State File Structure

```markdown
# Orchestration: {Task Name}

**Started**: {ISO timestamp}
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | FAILED | PAUSED

## Original Request
{Exact user request}

## Decomposition
1. {Step} → {subagent}
2. {Step} → {subagent}

## Execution Log

### Step 1: {Description}
- **Subagent**: {name}
- **Status**: ⏳ | 🔄 | ✅ | ❌
- **Result Summary**: {when complete}
- **Files Modified**: {if applicable}
- **Notes**: {issues, observations}

## Final Summary
{When complete}
```

### Resuming Orchestration

If a session is interrupted:

1. Find the state file: `ls .claude/state/`
2. Review progress: `cat .claude/state/{file}.md`
3. Tell Claude: "Resume orchestration from .claude/state/{file}.md, continuing from step N"

## Customization Guide

### Adding a New Subagent

1. Create `.claude/agents/core/{name}.md` for core agents, or `.claude/agents/packs/<pack>/{name}.md` for packs
2. Use this structure:

```markdown
---
name: {name}
description: {When to use this agent. Be specific.}
tools: {Comma-separated list}
model: haiku | sonnet | opus
---

# {Name} Agent

[Role description]

## Input Format
[What the agent expects]

## Output Format
[What the agent returns]

## Rules
[Agent-specific rules]
```

3. Add to CLAUDE.md's "Available Subagents" table
4. Create a template in `.claude/skills/orchestration/templates/`

### Adding a New Workflow

1. Create `.claude/commands/{workflow}.md`
2. Structure:

```markdown
---
description: {What this workflow does}
argument-hint: <expected arguments>
---

# {Workflow Name}

[Instructions for orchestrator]

## Phases
### Phase 1: ...
### Phase 2: ...

## Begin
Start with Phase 1 for: $ARGUMENTS
```

### Modifying Tool Access

Edit the `tools:` line in any subagent's frontmatter.

Available tools:
- `Read` - Read file contents
- `Write` - Create new files
- `Edit` - Modify existing files
- `Bash` - Run shell commands
- `Grep` - Search file contents
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Task` - Spawn subagents (main orchestrator only)

### Adjusting Model Selection

Edit the `model:` line in any subagent's frontmatter.

Options:
- `haiku` - Fast, cheap, good for simple tasks
- `sonnet` - Balanced, good for most work
- `opus` - Most capable, expensive
- `inherit` - Use main session's model

## Troubleshooting

### Subagent not being invoked

**Symptom**: Claude does something itself instead of delegating

**Fix**: 
1. Check CLAUDE.md is in project root
2. Verify agent file exists in `.claude/agents/core/` or `.claude/agents/packs/<pack>/`
3. Make description more specific with "Use proactively" language
4. Explicitly request: "Use the {name} subagent to..."

### State file not created

**Symptom**: No state tracking

**Fix**:
1. Verify `.claude/state/` directory exists
2. Check CLAUDE.md instructions mention state files
3. Use workflow commands which explicitly create state

### Logs not appearing

**Symptom**: Empty `.claude/logs/orchestration.jsonl`

**Fix**:
1. Verify `.claude/settings.json` is valid JSON
2. Check that hooks reference the `Task` tool
3. Ensure log directory exists: `mkdir -p .claude/logs`
4. Review hooks in Claude Code: `/hooks`

### Context bleeding between subagents

**Symptom**: Subagent seems to know things it shouldn't

**Reality**: This shouldn't happen—subagents get isolated context by design.

**If it does**:
1. The orchestrator may be including too much in the task prompt
2. Review the task template being used
3. Trim context to only essential information

### Orchestration feels slow

**Causes**:
1. Too many subagent invocations (each has ~20K overhead)
2. Using opus where sonnet would suffice
3. Tasks are too granular

**Fixes**:
1. Batch related work into single subagent calls
2. Use haiku for simple tasks
3. Combine steps that don't need isolation
