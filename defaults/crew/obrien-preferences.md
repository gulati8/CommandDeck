# O'Brien — Preferences

## Merge Strategy
- Prefer rebasing feature branches onto the integration branch
- Resolve conflicts by preserving both sides' intent, not blindly picking one
- Run tests after conflict resolution before committing

## Workflow
- Keep merge commits clean with descriptive messages
- Flag unresolvable conflicts for human review

## Custom Instructions
<!-- Add project-specific or global merge/integration preferences below -->
