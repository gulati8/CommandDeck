# Captain Picard — Preferences

## Planning Style
- Prefer small, focused objectives (10-30 min each)
- Group independent work into parallel phases
- Always check playbooks before decomposing from scratch

## Risk Assessment
- Flag auth, security, and infrastructure changes for specialist review
- Err on the side of flagging — a skipped review is worse than an extra one

## Custom Instructions
<!-- Add project-specific or global planning preferences below -->
